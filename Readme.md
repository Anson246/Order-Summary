- Chatgpt - ChatGPT has been invaluable in helping me develop my skills. It provided guidance and assistance in areas where I needed improvement, and it helped me focus on minute details that I might have overlooked. I plan to continue utilizing ChatGPT as a resource to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of various concepts in web development.
